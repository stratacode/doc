            <h2>Navigate by property</h2>
            Line markers for properties let you navigate the inheritance tree just like they do for types and methods. A property assignment at the top-level of a class can navigate to it's super and sub definitions. A super definition is either the definition of the property itself, or an assignment it overrides. A sub definition is any assignment in a sub layer. A field can navigate to any property assignments of that field.
