StrataCode is intended for programmers with experience using Java.

It requires: Java 8, Git, Unix (linux or mac, some windows support)

## IntelliJ plugin

Download and install the [IntelliJ plugin](ide/config.html) - a full featured IDE for StrataCode to build and run applications.

## Download the scc command

Download the scc.zip file [here](/download/) for the scc command and libraries.  Unzip this file to create the /home/scc directory:

      cd /home
      unzip ~/Downloads/scc.zip

Run or add to ~/.bashrc:

      export PATH=$PATH:/home/scc/bin

Test:

      scc -version

## Build from source

StrataCode is not open source but would make a great open source project if there's enough demand. It's a lot more fun to build when you have the source and we're looking for new partners to help so get in touch if you'd like to see more. With the source, run:

      mkdir /home/scc
      cd /home/scc
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/system.git 
      (or unzip the system.zip)

and read the Readme for setup.  https://github.com/stratacode/system.  It's not hard to build and run StrataCode programs using any IDE and there are sample gradle scripts included. 

In your IDE, just create a configuration with sc.layer.LayeredSystem as the 'mainClass'.

To build with scc first install the 'scc command' and then run the bin/makeSCC script. 

## Create a StrataCode Project

A StrataCode project contains one or more bundles of layers in the bundles directory.  You can create a directory from the IntelliJ plugin or by hand with:

      mkdir /home/StrataCode
      cd /home/StrataCode
      mkdir bundles
      cd bundles
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/coreFramework.git

You can add additional layer bundles as well (inside of the 'bundles' directory):

      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/example.git
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/managementUI.git
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/ecommerce.git

Add this configuration file so that the 'scc' command can find it's own source code:
<% ) %>

<pre><code>cd /home/StrataCode
mkdir conf
cat &gt; conf/scSourcePath
/home/scc/system
</code></pre>

## Running StrataCode Examples

From your /home/StrataCode directory run:

* Program editor and the expert system:

        scc editor/swing/main example/expertSystem/main

* Unit converter in swing

        scc example/unitConverter/swingui

* with the program editor:

        scc editor/swing/main example/unitConverter/swingui

* Unit converter in the web framework:

        scc example/unitConverter/html/clientServer

* With the program editor:

        scc editor/js/mixin example/unitConverter/html/clientServer 

If you have problems after code changes, use the '-a' option to build all files or remove the layer's build directory in /home/StrataCode/build.
Third party packages are installed by default in ~/.stratacode/pkgs.

There's a usage for the scc command or type "help" at the command line.
