If you're interested in hands on, contact Jeff Vroom for more info.

There are some old videos that might still be helpful but lots of names have changed [demo videos](../videos.html).  

Prerequisites: Experience with Java, Git, Unix (linux or mac, some windows support)

## Download StrataCode runtime

Get the [IntelliJ plugin](ide/config.html) which includes the runtime or download a release from github. This installs the scc command and all the libraries you need to create a project.

## Option: Build from source

Currently StrataCode is not open source while we determine the right license and find a way to support developers building development tools.  Contact Jeff for access to the source tree as it's a lot more fun to build when you have the source. Once you have access, you can run:

      mkdir /home/scc
      cd /home/scc
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/system.git 

and read the Readme for setup.  https://github.com/stratacode/system.  It's easy to build with your IDE, StrataCode or Gradle.

When built with StrataCode, it produces the "scc" command script.  In your IDE, just create a configuration with sc.layer.LayeredSystem as the 'mainClass'.

## Create a StrataCode Project

A StrataCode project contains one or more bundles of layers in the bundles directory.  You can create a directory from the IntelliJ plugin or by hand with:

      mkdir /home/StrataCode
      cd /home/StrataCode
      mkdir bundles
      cd bundles
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/coreFramework.git

You can add additional layer bundles as well (inside of the 'bundles' directory):

      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/example.git
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/managementUI.git
      git clone https://github.com/stratacode/ecommerce.git

Add this so that the 'scc' command can find it's own source code:
<% ) %>

<pre><code>cd /home/StrataCode
mkdir conf
cat &gt; conf/scSourcePath
/home/scc/system
</code></pre>

## Running StrataCode Examples

From your /home/StrataCode directory run:

* Program editor and the expert system:

        scc editor/swing/main example/expertSystem/main

* Unit converter in swing

        scc example/unitConverter/swingui

* with the program editor:

        scc editor/swing/main example/unitConverter/swingui

* Unit converter in the web framework:

        scc example/unitConverter/html/clientServer

* With the program editor:

        scc editor/js/mixin example/unitConverter/html/clientServer 

If you have problems after code changes, use the '-a' option to build all files or remove the layer's build directory in /home/StrataCode/build

There's a usage for the scc command and type "help" at the command line.
