This example shows how to tag a build with info from when it was built.  Here the version number, git hash, timestamp, and user name are put into the generated .java file so it's an accurate reflection of when the code was built.  There are several features demonstrated: 
<ul>
<li>How to define a property in a layer for use by subsequent layers (scmVersion).   
<li>Running shell commands in a layer definition file.
<li>Using the @BuildInit annotation to initialize a runtime property to the value of a build-time expression. The build-time expressions are run in the context of the buildLayer using the dynamic runtime so they can refer to layer components, or layer fields in any layer in the current build stack but not the class being generated.  It can also use the "layeredSystem" property or any static methods available in the dynamic runtime.  If there are errors in the build time expression, those will be visible at compile time (TODO: support edit time resolution here like we do for schtml attributes?).
<li>How to initialize a runtime property from layered .properties files 
</ul>

Here's the buildTag layer definition file, run at build time: 
<%= sc.lang.SCLanguage.INSTANCE.styleFile("example/buildTag", "buildTag.sc", false, true) %>
It defines the layer field 'scmVersion' which is initialized by running git and parsing the result to produce an informative string that includes information about local changes in the repository at the time of the build.  The 'init' method is run just after the layer is constructed, before the start and validate methods. 

</p>

<p>
Here's the source for the BuildTag subclass that is generated to include the build info:
<%= sc.lang.SCLanguage.INSTANCE.styleFile("example/buildTag", "ExBuildTag.sc", false, false) %>

<ul>
<li> The @BuildInit annotation is a bridge between 'build time' and 'run time'.  It's used to initialize runtime properties to build time expressions.  
<li> The call to getLayerProperty looks for a build.properties in the top-level layer directory, merging those in subsequent layers.  Layer properties can be overridden using the -P option to scc that works like Java's -D.  Use: 'scc -Pbuild.tag=release', and  'getLayerProperty("build", "tag")'. 
</ul>


<div class="filename">example/buildTag/build.properties</div>
<div class="code"><pre>
<%= sc.util.FileUtil.getFileAsString(sc.layer.LayeredSystem.getCurrent().getMainLayeredSystem().getStrataCodeDir("bundles/example/example/buildTag/build.properties")) %>
</pre></div>

</p>

To compile a release build, you can override the defaults by adding a command line option:

<code>scc -Pbuild.tag=release example.buildTag</code>
