### About

Jeff Vroom, the author of StrataCode, has previously helped design and built three successful platforms: AVS, ATG/Dynamo, and Flex Data Services. The last ten years, while developing StrataCode he has worked as a Software Architecture consultant, writing code, reviewing and providing advice on software design.

His passion is readable, declarative, manageable, traceable code using typing, that produces cost-effective, efficient systems that are more adaptable to changing requirements.

### Contributors

Rollin Crittendon helped build the CSS grammar and provide valuable advice.
